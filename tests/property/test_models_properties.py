"""Property tests for ``fit_dose_response`` (plan section 6.4; hypothesis).

Four properties, matching the test-author brief and the Phase 4 plan's Files table:

- Aggregated counts give a fit identical to the equivalent ``from_observations`` rows (R1).
- Row permutation changes nothing.
- With ``u=1`` fixed, adding an all-success control row leaves the fit unchanged.
- On a log axis, ``x -> c*x`` shifts ``mu`` by ``log(c)`` and leaves ``s`` unchanged.

The first two do **not** require the fit to converge: two representations of *exactly the same
counts* must give exactly the same ``Fit`` -- including when that fit fails, since
``fit_dose_response`` is a deterministic function of the pooled cell counts (R1's own wording),
not of row order or representation. The third and fourth properties are about what a
**successful** fit does, so they use ``hypothesis.assume`` to skip examples that do not
converge, after choosing strategies designed to make that the common case (per the brief:
"keep designs non-separated").

Examples are kept small (few levels, small trial counts) so real optimizer calls stay fast, per
the brief.

**The control-row property above (``test_adding_an_all_success_control_leaves_a_fixed_u_1_fit_
unchanged``) only ever calls ``_fit_fixed_trivial`` (``upper=1.0, lower=0.0``), the ``GLM``
path.** `docs/REVIEWS.md` R10 "Still open" item 1 reports that the *other* fixed-``upper=1.0``
path -- ``lower="estimate"``, ``GenericLikelihoodModel`` -- violates the same plan section 6.4
property: statsmodels' own ``LikelihoodModel.fit`` minimises ``-loglike(params) / nobs``, and
``nobs`` changes when a row is added even though the control's own contribution to the
log-likelihood is exactly ``0``. ``test_adding_an_all_success_control_to_the_generic_path_
leaves_status_unchanged`` below extends the same strategy to that path, asserting status
equality unconditionally (never behind an ``assume``, which would hide exactly the mismatch
this property exists to catch -- the lesson of R9's "assume... stepping around a defect").
