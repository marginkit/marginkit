"""Owner decision 2026-10-15: ``fit_dose_response`` on a control-only observation (a log axis
whose only severity level is the ``0.0`` control) must raise a clear ``ValueError``, not the
unhelpful numpy internal error it raises today.

Confirmed against the current fitter before writing this test (per ``CLAUDE.md``'s working
rhythm): an **all-success** control-only observation raises
``ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity`` on both
fitting paths (``GLM``, ``upper=1.0, lower=0.0``; and ``GenericLikelihoodModel``, ``upper=1.0,
lower="estimate"``), for every link (``probit``, ``logit``, ``cloglog``) -- there is only one
likelihood-contributing severity level, the control itself contributes none on a log axis (R3),
and something downstream (span/centering-and-scale computation over an empty nonzero-severity
array) calls ``numpy.max``/``numpy.min`` on an array of length 0.

A control-only observation whose control *has failures* does not reach this at all: it is
``Status.CONTROL_INCOMPATIBLE`` before any fitting is attempted (``models.py``'s own pre-fit
check, plan section 5.1), which is why this file's fixture is deliberately all-success -- the
case this decision actually targets.
