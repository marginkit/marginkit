#
# Every JSON file records the R, drc and MASS versions actually used, plus (where relevant) the
# drc -> robustmargin parameter mapping this run empirically confirmed:
#   mu = log(e); s is +-1/b depending on which response was fit and which direction it moves in
#   (see the "mapping" block written into each file -- section 5.1's "check drc's sign
#   convention" turned into a recorded fact, not a comment).
#
# Run via the exact container command in the README. Do not run against a host R install: the
# CRAN snapshot and package versions must be pinned and reproducible.
