"""Property tests for the failed-fit exact bracket (``decisions/0028``).

Two properties of ``censoring.classify`` on a failed fit (``SEPARATION`` / ``NOT_CONVERGED``)
whose result is an exact-bound fallback (censoring ``NONE``, not ``FAILS_AT_BASELINE``, no
``NON_MONOTONE: `` contradiction):

* **The run property (any data).** A reported ``lo`` is the end of an unbroken run: every nonzero
  severity at or below it confidently passes, and the next nonzero severity above it does not.
  A reported ``hi`` is the mirror image from the top, control included. A side that is not
  reported is one whose run cannot begin: the lowest nonzero severity does not confidently pass
  (or the highest severity does not confidently fail) at the bracket confidence. The
  confidence of a reported side is ``(1 + level) / 2`` when both are reported and ``level``
  when only one is. This is the definition of a fixed-sequence scan, checked on arbitrary
  counts rather than on hand-picked grids; it fails on the max-anywhere rule as soon as a
  passing (or failing) cell sits behind a gap.
* **Clean data is unchanged.** When the confidently passing cells form a prefix of the nonzero
  severities and the confidently failing cells a suffix of all severities, at both confidences,
  the result equals what the max-anywhere rule gave. ``0028``: "When the confidently passing and
  failing cells are each contiguous from their end, the result is identical."

Examples are small and the search is hypothesis's own (seeded, deterministic) one; the explicit
``@example`` cases keep both properties from being vacuous by guaranteeing the interesting
non-contiguous shapes are always tried.
