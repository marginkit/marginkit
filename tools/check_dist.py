"""Check the built sdist and wheel in ``dist/`` before they are published.

Run after ``python -m build``: ``python tools/check_dist.py [--expect-version X.Y.Z]``. Both the
``packaging shape`` CI job and the release workflow call this file, so there is one copy of the
check (CLAUDE.md, on second copies of a rule).

A missing ``py.typed`` fails silently and disables type checking for every consumer, and
``load_schema(version)`` reads the packaged schemas at runtime, so both are asserted inside the
built wheel rather than merely on disk.

Both artifacts are also checked against an allowlist of what may ship: the package's modules,
``py.typed``, the score-card schema, ``LICENSE``, ``pyproject.toml``, the build's own metadata,
and ``README.md`` as the only documentation, since it is the PyPI project page. The planning
documents, ``CHANGELOG.md``, tests and tools never ship. The check is an allowlist rather than
a list of known-private paths, so a new file in an artifact fails it until someone decides it
belongs there.
