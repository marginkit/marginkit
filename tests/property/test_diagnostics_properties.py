"""Property tests for :func:`~robustmargin.diagnose` (plan section 6.4; hypothesis;
``docs/decisions/0023-fit-diagnostics-and-schema-v3.md``).

Three properties, mirroring ``tests/property/test_models_properties.py``'s own conventions and
strategies rather than introducing new ones:

- Row permutation changes nothing (``diagnose`` is a pure function of ``fit.cells``, which
  ``Observations.cells()`` already pools and sorts regardless of row order).
- Aggregated and disaggregated inputs give identical diagnostics, for the same reason.
- With ``u`` fixed at 1, adding an all-success control row leaves ``deviance``,
  ``pearson_chi2``, ``df`` and ``dispersion`` unchanged (plan section 6.4's own control-row
  property, extended here per the test-author brief). This is the property that pins down this
  phase's own design decision: a cell whose fitted success probability is exactly ``1.0`` (the
  control, under ``upper=1.0`` fixed) is excluded from those four statistics, the same way R's
  own ``glm`` drops that row entirely (see ``tests/unit/test_validation.py``'s module docstring
  and ``tests/reference/test_diagnostics_drc.py``). ``link_aic``/``link_status`` are **not**
  asserted equal here: adding a row can change which alternative links converge, so the brief
  scopes this property to the four GOF/dispersion fields only. (``Fit.monotonicity`` is a
  separate field entirely as of decisions/0023's Amendment 1 -- never touched by ``Diagnostics``
  or by this file; its own aggregation/permutation properties live in
  ``tests/property/test_monotonicity_properties.py``.)

Examples are kept small, per the existing file's own convention, so real optimizer calls stay
fast.

    all-success control row at severity 0.0 prepended. The control is excluded from the
    separation check entirely regardless of its own counts (R3: a log-axis zero-severity control
    carries no covariate information), so prepending it here can never introduce separation on
    its own.

    Originally drew ``successes`` freely in ``[0, trials]`` at every level, including the
    nonzero ones, which routinely produced separated (and occasionally non-converged) fits and
    tripped Hypothesis's ``filter_too_much`` health check on the ``assume(status is OK)`` calls
    below roughly one run in three. Narrowing the *generator* here (rather than suppressing the
    health check) is the fix: a fit built from this strategy converges to ``Status.OK`` in the
    overwhelming majority of draws, so ``assume`` only ever discards the rare, genuine
    non-convergence (for example a wrong-sign pilot slope), not a systematic fraction of them.
