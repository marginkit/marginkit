"""Property tests for ``robustmargin.empirical.grid_break_point`` (hypothesis).

Invariants that must hold for any valid input, not just the hand-picked cases in
``tests/unit/test_empirical.py``: permutation invariance, ``value`` is always one of the
tested magnitudes (or ``None``), ``value is None`` if and only if the criterion held at every
level if and only if ``censoring is Censoring.RIGHT``, ``max_tested`` is the max magnitude, and
agreement with a direct, independent re-statement of zeta-bench's own two-line rule
(``robustness/cards.py::break_point``, lines 137-139). Example counts are kept modest so the
suite stays fast (plan section 6.4 lists these as the invariants that matter most).
